Front-end Quickstarter Boilerplate
=======================================================

Based on [HTML5Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com), this is the base structure and files used for my front-end developments.

This is quite simple for the moment, with just a few minors changes from HTML5Boilerplate regarding the forlders structure and the use of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) & [Compass](http://compass-style.org)
